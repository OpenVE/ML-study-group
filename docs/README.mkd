# ML Docs

Here we will store all the documents in two different folders,
notes and resources.

## Notes

The notes folder will have all the notes that we consider important
while learning, as well as some concrete understanding of topics and
considerations for the future.

## Resources

The resources folder will have all the resources that we'll be using
in series of links to foreighn servers.
